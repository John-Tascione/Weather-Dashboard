# Weather-Dashboard

The weather dashboad app takes a user input city and runs two API calls to provide weather data. The first API takes the input city and produces the corresponding lattitude and longitude. After this information has been stored in a variable the latitude and longitude is used in the second API call to fetch weather data.
